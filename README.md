**CNN for Image Classification**  
This repository contains an implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project demonstrates how CNNs can be used to classify 60,000 32x32 color images into 10 different classes. The code includes model architecture, training procedures, evaluation metrics, and performance analysis.  

Key features:
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification
- Training with Adam optimizer and data augmentation techniques
- Performance comparison with advanced models like ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121
- Evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset with accuracy and loss curves
